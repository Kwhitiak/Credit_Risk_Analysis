# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
in this project, we will be analysing credit risk from, data in loan_stats.csv.  we will be using a variety of models to help predict whether or not someone is low risk or hgih risk for loans.  We will be building these models using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to help evaluate them.  


## Results:





## Summary:

in summary, the first four models used undersampling, oversampling and a combination of both to determine whish model is better at determining risk levels of individuals.  The last two models we used to help predict which loans are risky used resampling techniques using ensemble classifiers.  due to its high accuracy and good balance of precision and recall scores, the Easy Ensemble model is better at the rest at predictiing levels or risk.
